@article{Sussman2013,
abstract = {We present a method to estimate block membership of nodes in a random graph generated by a stochastic blockmodel. We use an embedding procedure motivated by the random dot product graph model, a particular example of the latent position model. The embedded vectors are clustered through minimization of a mean square error/criteria. We prove that this method is consistent for assigning nodes to blocks, as only a negligible number of nodes will be mis-assigned. We prove consistency of the method for directed and undirected graphs. The consistent block assignment makes possible consistent parameter estimation for a stochastic blockmodel. We extend the result for when the number of blocks grows slowly with the number of nodes. Our method is also computationally feasible even for very large graphs.},

@article{Tang2016,
abstract = {AbstractTwo-sample hypothesis testing for random graphs arises naturally in neuroscience, social networks, and machine learning. In this paper, we consider a semiparametric problem of two-sample hypothesis testing for a class of latent position random graphs. We formulate a notion of consistency in this context and propose a valid test for the hypothesis that two finite-dimensional random dot product graphs on a common vertex set have the same generating latent positions or have generating latent positions that are scaled or diagonal transformations of one another. Our test statistic is a function of a spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix for each graph and our test procedure is consistent across a broad range of alternatives. We apply our test procedure to real biological data: in a test-retest data set of neural connectome graphs, we are able to distinguish between scans from different subjects; and in the C.elegans connectome, we are able to distinguish between chemical and electrical network...},

@article{Eklund2015,
abstract = {The most widely used task fMRI analyses use parametric methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. While individual aspects of these fMRI models have been evaluated, they have not been evaluated in a comprehensive manner with empirical data. In this work, a total of 2 million random task fMRI group analyses have been performed using resting state fMRI data, to compute empirical familywise error rates for the software packages SPM, FSL and AFNI, as well as a standard non-parametric permutation method. While there is some variation, for a nominal familywise error rate of 5{\%} the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxel-wise inference and invalid for cluster-wise inference; in particular, cluster size inference with a cluster defining threshold of p = 0.01 generates familywise error rates up to 60{\%}. We conduct a number of follow up analyses and investigations that suggest the cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial auto correlation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the non-parametric permutation test, which is based on a small number of assumptions, is found to produce valid results for voxel as well as cluster wise inference. Using real task data, we compare the results between one parametric method and the permutation test, and find stark differences in the conclusions drawn between the two using cluster inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the neuroimaging field.},

@article{Fosdick2015,
abstract = {Network analysis is often focused on characterizing the dependencies between network relations and node-level attributes. Potential relationships are typically explored by modeling the network as a function of the nodal attributes or by modeling the attributes as a function of the network. These methods require specification of the exact nature of the association between the network and attributes, reduce the network data to a small number of summary statistics, and are unable to provide predictions simultaneously for missing attribute and network information. Existing methods that model the attributes and network jointly also assume the data are fully observed. In this article, we introduce a unified approach to analysis that addresses these shortcomings. We use a previously developed latent variable model to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the network in terms of node-specific network factors. We introduce a novel testing procedure to determine if dependencies exist between the network factor...},

abstract = {In classical analysis of variance, dispersion is measured by considering squared distances of sample elements from the sample mean. We consider a measure of dispersion for univariate or multivariate response based on all pairwise distances between-sample elements, and derive an analogous distance components (DISCO) decomposition for powers of distance in {\$}(0,2]{\$}. The ANOVA F statistic is obtained when the index (exponent) is 2. For each index in {\$}(0,2){\$}, this decomposition determines a nonparametric test for the multi-sample hypothesis of equal distributions that is statistically consistent against general alternatives.},

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {Owing to random memory access patterns, sparse matrix multiplication is traditionally performed in memory and scales to large matrices using the distributed memory of multiple nodes. In contrast, we scale sparse matrix multiplication by utilizing commodity SSDs. We implement sparse matrix dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) in a semi-external memory (SEM) fashion, i.e., we keep the sparse matrix on SSDs and dense matrices in memory. Our SEM SpMM can incorporate many in-memory optimizations for large power- law graphs with near-random vertex connection. Coupled with many I/O optimizations, our SEM SpMM achieves performance comparable to our in-memory implementation on a large parallel machine and outperforms the implementations in Trilinos and Intel MKL. Our experiments show that the SEM SpMM achieves almost 100{\%} performance of the in-memory implementation on graphs when the dense matrix has more than four columns; it achieves at least 65{\%} performance of the in-memory implementation for all of our graphs when the dense matrix has only one column. We apply our SpMM to three important data analysis applications and show that our SSD-based implementations can significantly outperform state of the art of these applications and scale to billion-node graphs.},

@article{Szekely2004,
abstract = {We propose a new nonparametric test for equality of two or more multivariate distributions based on Euclidean distance between sample elements. Several consistent tests for comparing multivariate distributions can be developed from the underlying theoretical results. The test procedure for the multisample problem is developed and applied for testing the composite hypothesis of equal distributions, when distributions are unspecified. The proposed test is universally consistent against all fixed alternatives (not necessarily continuous) with finite second moments. The test is implemented by conditioning on the pooled sample to obtain an approximate permutation test, which is distribution free. Our Monte Carlo power study suggests that the new test may be much more sensitive than tests based on nearest neighbors against several classes of alternatives, and performs particularly well in high dimension. Computational complexity of our test procedure is independent of dimension and number of populations sampled. The test is applied in a high dimensional problem, testing microarray data from cancer samples.},
